# ALX Backend Javascript

## Learning Path
---

### 🧱 **1. Learn the Basics of JavaScript (if you haven’t yet)**
Before diving into backend development, make sure you're comfortable with JavaScript fundamentals:

- **Variables, functions, loops, conditionals**
- **ES6+ features** (arrow functions, destructuring, spread/rest operators, `let`/`const`, promises, async/await)
- **Arrays and objects**
- **Understanding how the call stack works**

📚 Resources:
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)
- [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

---

### 🔧 **2. Understand What the Backend Actually Is**
Know what backend devs do:
- Handling requests/responses
- Dealing with databases
- Authentication & security
- APIs (RESTful and sometimes GraphQL)
- Server configuration & deployment

---

### 🚀 **3. Learn Node.js**
Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server.

Focus on:
- Core modules (like `fs`, `http`, `path`)
- npm (Node Package Manager) and installing packages
- Writing a simple HTTP server
- Understanding asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await)

📚 Resource: [Node.js Official Docs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs)

---

### 🧰 **4. Dive Into Express.js**
Express.js is the most popular backend framework for Node.js.

Learn how to:
- Set up a basic server
- Handle routing (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)
- Work with middleware
- Handle errors
- Use Postman or Insomnia for testing

### 🛢️ **5. Learn About Databases**
Pick a database to learn. Start with:

- **MongoDB** (NoSQL, easy to get started, JavaScript-friendly)
- OR **PostgreSQL/MySQL** (SQL databases)

Learn how to:
- Connect your database to your Express app
- Perform CRUD operations
- Understand models and schemas (especially with MongoDB and Mongoose)

---

### 🧪 **6. Learn How to Test Your APIs**
Start simple:
- Manual testing with Postman
- Write tests using tools like Jest or Supertest

---

### 🔐 **7. Understand Authentication and Authorization**
Implement:
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Role-based access control

---

### 🌐 **8. Learn About RESTful APIs**
Design and build RESTful endpoints:
- Route naming conventions
- Status codes
- CRUD operations via API

Eventually, you might explore **GraphQL**, but start with REST.

---

### ☁️ **9. Learn About Deployment**
Get your app online:
- Use services like:
  - **Render** (easy, free tier)
  - **Vercel** (if using frontend + backend)
  - **Railway**
  - **Heroku** (though it's not as free as it used to be)

Understand:
- Environment variables
- Basic CI/CD
- Hosting databases in the cloud (like MongoDB Atlas)

---

### 🧑‍💻 **10. Build Projects**
Apply everything with hands-on projects:
- Todo app with user login
- Blog API
- REST API for a movie/book app
- Chat app using WebSockets
- E-commerce backend
